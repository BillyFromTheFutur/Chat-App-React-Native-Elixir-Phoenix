Chat-App-React-Native-Elixir-Phoenix



------------------------------------
the server part was initaially called Weekend because i was on a weekend when i coded it.

The mobile part is called ElixirWay because i was not that much inspired when i did It.

I don't know but some days i will try to step up in Elixir and then i'll update the projet but that's not how i see it now, in fact i want to move to Golang because i already know C and Java so i think it will be way more easier for me to understand complex things like WebRTC , Channels Pub/Sub , Presence.
